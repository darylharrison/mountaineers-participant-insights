Mountaineers Participant Insights
=================================

This userscript provides Mountaineers leaders with participant statistics and notes directly on profile pages and small activity rosters. It focuses on the last 12 months of data, specifically displaying cancellation and no show counts along with previous participation notes. The script ignores data from course- or event-related activities and excludes activities cancelled by the leader. For efficiency, all data is calculated and cached once per calendar day.

It is important to note that the script lacks context regarding why or when a cancellation occurred. It cannot distinguish between an early withdrawal and a last-minute cancellation, nor can it identify if a user was simply removing themselves from a waitlist. Consequently, leaders should use these summary statistics as a general reference to inform follow-up conversations rather than a definitive metric.
